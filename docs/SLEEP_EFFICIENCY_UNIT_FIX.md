# Sleep Efficiency Unit Fix

## 🐛 **Issue Fixed**

### **Unnecessary "%" Unit**
- **Problem**: Sleep efficiency was displaying with "%" unit (e.g., "86 %")
- **Solution**: Removed "%" unit from sleep efficiency metric

## ✅ **Change Applied**

### **Database Update**
```sql
UPDATE standard_metrics 
SET unit = '' 
WHERE metric_key = 'sleep_efficiency';
```

## 🎯 **Visual Result**

### **Before:**
- Sleep Efficiency: "86 %" ❌

### **After:**
- Sleep Efficiency: "86" ✅

## 📊 **Rationale**

Sleep efficiency is typically understood as a percentage without needing the "%" symbol, making the display cleaner and more consistent with other score-based metrics like:
- Sleep Score: "70" (no unit)
- Sleep Quality: "8" (no unit)
- Readiness Score: "80" (no unit)

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **Visual Check:**
- Sleep efficiency should now display just the number "86" without "%"
- Should look cleaner and more consistent with other score metrics
